# Secuela Variable Font - OFL 1.1 - 2018

Secuela is my new **Variable Typeface** (5 standard weights), Sans serif and condensed **(Regular & Italics)** with OFL license, of geometric construction and neo-Gothic style with short descenders and a humanistic finish in the curves to avoid the coldness of purely grotesque typographies, evoking a feeling of warmth and personality , which results in a friendly and very readable typography, is specially drawn for the composition of any text, signage or headlines, both for printing and for screen.

The typography has 787 glyphs (Latin Extended-A) with capital letters in small caps, advanced OpenType functions, several number games, the Bitcoin symbol and a meticulous configuration of metrics and Kerning.

The styles in italics have lowercase letters of their own and some capital letters, as well as multiple optical corrections to correct the deformations produced by the 8-degree inclination.

I intend to expand the table of characters to add the Greek alphabet and Cyrillic. I appreciate any kind of collaboration and comments to improve this typographic family.

I have included, in the fonts both the individual versions (12 styles) and the variable versions (Regular & Italic) compatible with Adobe CC 2018.
